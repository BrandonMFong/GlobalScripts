Basic Use
---------

Connector implements JDBC API with minimal extensions and minimal
reductions of methods, that do not make sense in C++

To be able to use API, a program should include its definition in ConnCpp.h
header

#include  <ConnCpp.h>

To obtain driver instance:
sql::Driver* driver= sql::mariadb::get_driver_instance();

To connect
std::unique_ptr<Connection> conn(driver->connect(url, properties));

For URL syntax and options name you may refer to
https://mariadb.com/kb/en/about-mariadb-connector-j/
but not all options will have effect at the moment.
Properties is map of strings, and is another way to pass optional parameters.

In addition to Connector/J URL style and JDBC connect method, Connector/C++ supports
following connect methods:

std::unique_ptr<Connection> conn(driver->connect(host, username, pwd));

and

std::unique_ptr<Connection> conn(driver->connect(properties));

Host in former case is  (tcp|unix|pipe)://<host>[:port][/<db>]
Properties in the latter case are the same, as in the first variant of the connect
method, plus additionally supported
  - hostName,
  - pipe,
  - socket,
  - schema

For further use one may refer to JDBC specs.

Except Driver object, normally this is application's responsibility to delete
objects returned by the connector.
