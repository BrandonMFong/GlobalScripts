Issue: Everytime we add a column to a table, we need to manual do that to all dbs
    Fix Commit: 81917b0
    Branch: major-feature-SetupTablesWithConfig 
    Status: Closed
    Notes:
        - Config should describe necessary tables for that class object
            - Config should be define under the object
        - Using info schema to see if table exists
            - if table doesn't exist, then you are going to make the columns too (sql server syntax)
        - Finished the code but I am worried my data will be compromised in the code
            - there is no drop or delete queries.  I think it's safe to say that my data wont get lost.  I will back up just in case
    Post:
        - Everything under the <sql> tag will be considered in the queries.  
        - Only adds or creates columns/tables.  No deletion.  
            - Should not have deletions just in case of config errors and risk of lost data

    Branch: feature-PointToOtherXMLOption
    Notes:
        - I have to push my config everytime I edit my list 
        - Make a redirect capability to look at another xml file 
        - Changing config
            - Adding a new param in List object config 
        - Test runs
            - Trial 1
                - Redirect worked for lists that are redirecting
                - This affects the lists that are not redirecting
                - Adding [string]::isnullorempty()
            - Trial 2
                - Success
                - Properly compared null value

Issue: HashTable Type Bug
    Status: Closed
    Fix Commit: ebfd70f 
    Branch: bug-HashTable 
    Notes:
        - I don't think the FindInterval function finds the correct interval
        - The $u variable was only incrementing when there was another node found
            - it does not consider that the node is indexes away
    Post:
        - This was a quick fix that needed a code change for the FindInterval method
