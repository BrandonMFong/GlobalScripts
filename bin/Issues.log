    Status: Closed
    Fix Commit: ebfd70f 
    Notes:
        - I don't think the FindInterval function finds the correct interval
        - The $u variable was only incrementing when there was another node found
            - it does not consider that the node is indexes away
    Post:
        - This was a quick fix that needed a code change for the FindInterval method
