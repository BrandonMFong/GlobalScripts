        - I have to push my config everytime I edit my list

        - Changing config
            - Adding a new param in List object config 
        - Test runs
            - Trial 1
                - Redirect worked for lists that are redirecting
                - This affects the lists that are not redirecting
                - Adding [string]::isnullorempty()
            - Trial 2
                - Success

Issue: HashTable Type Bug

    Branch: bug-HashTable 
    Notes:
        - I don't think the FindInterval function finds the correct interval
        - The $u variable was only incrementing when there was another node found
            - it does not consider that the node is indexes away
    Post:
        - This was a quick fix that needed a code change for the FindInterval method
