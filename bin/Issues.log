Issue: HashTable Type Bug
    Fix Commit: ebfd70f 
    Notes:
        - I don't think the FindInterval function finds the correct interval
        - The $u variable was only incrementing when there was another node found
            - it does not consider that the node is indexes away
    Post:
        - This was a quick fix that needed a code change for the FindInterval method

Issue: Archive errors out when there is a an item with the same name

    Notes:
        - Maybe write an exception error

        - Just made a function that appends the version of the files
            - Example : File <Version Number>.txt
