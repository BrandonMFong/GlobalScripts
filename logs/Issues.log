        - hmmmm, might just be the fact that I did not restart the session.  XmlReader still must have had the StartScript node

            - Should there be another type for break?

            - Added a join column
        
Issue: Addprogram not inserting into db
    Fix Commit:  
    Branch:  
    Status: Closed
    Notes: 
        - I do not see the issue on my end
        - Might be an issue on the computer itself.
            - Maybe a database instance issue
    Post:
        - The max of value was 100 and any value with length 100+ will not be inserted

Issue: Cal object not printing other months
    Fix Commit: 552ebac
    Branch: bug-MonthsNotChanging
    Status: Closed
    Notes: 
        - The overloaded function updated the main 'Today' field before the check
            - The check was to see if the weeks were already loaded
            - This resulted in the getcalendarmonth to alway use the method 
    Post: 
        - Reset the WeeksLoaded bool private field in the Overloaded GetNow() method

Issue: Can only edit list once
    Fix Commit: 0729035
    Branch: NA
    Status: Closed
    Notes: 
        - Seems that I can reload after every profile reload
        - works when I reload objects too
    Post: 
        - The week-list.ps1 script edits after reloading all objects 
            - makes it seem like it isn't 
        - There was actually a bool check that didn't allow the the edit to go through

    Branch: NA
    Status: Closed
    Notes: 
        - Just never worked well as an object
        - Don't really need it as an object anyways
        - But should think about it if you have different emails in outlook
    Post:
        - Changing to script

Issue: Everytime we add a column to a table, we need to manual do that to all dbs
    Fix Commit: 81917b0
    Branch: major-feature-SetupTablesWithConfig 
    Status: Closed
    Notes:
        - Config should describe necessary tables for that class object
            - Config should be define under the object
        - Using info schema to see if table exists
            - if table doesn't exist, then you are going to make the columns too (sql server syntax)
        - Finished the code but I am worried my data will be compromised in the code
            - there is no drop or delete queries.  I think it's safe to say that my data wont get lost.  I will back up just in case
    Post:
        - Everything under the <sql> tag will be considered in the queries.  
        - Only adds or creates columns/tables.  No deletion.  
            - Should not have deletions just in case of config errors and risk of lost data

    Notes:
        - How do you time a function in powershell?
        - Don't really use it a lot anyways
    Post:
        - Only used at startscript and I would see the issue there 
        - Now just calling it whenever.  
        - The site seems to have a lot of traffic and has a limit to its request

    Branch: feature-PointToOtherXMLOption
    Notes:
        - I have to push my config everytime I edit my list 
        - Make a redirect capability to look at another xml file 
        - Changing config
            - Adding a new param in List object config 
        - Test runs
            - Trial 1
                - Redirect worked for lists that are redirecting
                - This affects the lists that are not redirecting
                - Adding [string]::isnullorempty()
            - Trial 2
                - Success
                - Properly compared null value

Issue: HashTable Type Bug
    Status: Closed
    Fix Commit: ebfd70f 
    Branch: bug-HashTable 
    Notes:
        - I don't think the FindInterval function finds the correct interval
        - The $u variable was only incrementing when there was another node found
            - it does not consider that the node is indexes away
    Post:
        - This was a quick fix that needed a code change for the FindInterval method

    Notes:
        - Maybe write an exception error 
    Post:
        - Just made a function that appends the version of the files
            - Example : File <Version Number>.txt
